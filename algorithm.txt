Algorithm:

1. Print a welcome message for the Phone Bill Activity.

2. Prompt the user to enter the cellphone subscription package (Green, Blue, or Purple) in lowercase.

3. Read the user input for the package name and convert it to lowercase.

4. Check if the entered package name is valid:
    - If the package is "green":
        - Set base cost to $49.99.
        - Set base data to 2 GB.
        - Set base additional cost to $15.
    - If the package is "blue":
        - Set base cost to $70.
        - Set base data to 4 GB.
        - Set base additional cost to $10.
    - If the package is "purple":
        - Set base cost to $99.95.
        - Set base data to unlimited.
        - Set base additional cost to $15.
    - If the package is none of the above, print "Invalid package name" and end the program.

5. If the package is valid:
    - Prompt the user to enter the amount of data used in GB.
    - Read the user input for data used.

6. Calculate the total cost based on the package:
    - If the base data is unlimited (for Purple package):
        - Set total cost to the base cost.
    - Otherwise:
        - Calculate the extra data used beyond the base data.
        - Add it to the base cost along with the base additional cost.

7. If the package is "green" and the total cost is $75 or more, apply a discount of $20.

8. Print the total bill amount in currency format.

9. End of the program.
